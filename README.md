## Cocktail Critic

Cocktail Critic is an app that allows logged in users to search for popular alcoholic drinks and add their own personal review and rating. Users can browse other users reviews as well as see a collection of their own reviews which they can reference later.

## Motivation

I wanted to make a fun app that I felt users would find interesting as I am sure everyone has ordered a drink they wanted to make sure they would or wouldn't try again.  As someone who enjoys the occasional drink, I have been the victim of trying a new drink and absolutely hating it so I thought it would be a cool idea to create a personal and public review board for cocktails.
